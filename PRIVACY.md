Slicer Privacy Policy

Last updated: 17 Aug 2025

Slicer never sells your data and shows no ads. We keep data to the minimum needed to make the app work.

What the app stores

On your device (SecureStore):

Spotify access/refresh tokens and granted scopes

Your Spotify product tier (“premium/free/open”)

Short-lived “pending play” info to resume playback after auth

Daily cleanup counter (free-tier limit)

Theme preference

iOS only: local in-app purchase flags (is Pro, plan)

We do not run a user account or database for Slicer.
No Spotify user ID, email, playlists, or listening history is uploaded to our servers.

Data we read temporarily

To show and sort your cleanup stack we call Spotify APIs to read:

Your playlists and their tracks

Recently played and top tracks (for ranking)

These are used in-app and not persisted to any server.

Third-party services

Spotify SDK & Web API to authenticate and control playback.

Apple StoreKit (iOS) for purchases.

Stripe (Android) via hosted Checkout/Portal pages. Slicer never sees your card details.

Analytics & tracking

None. No analytics SDKs and no third-party advertising.

Security & retention

All data kept by Slicer is stored locally on your device. Delete the app to remove it.
If you email support, we’ll keep your message history only as long as needed to help.
