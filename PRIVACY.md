# Slicer Privacy Policy
_Last updated: 17 Aug 2025_

Slicer never sells your data and shows no ads. We keep data to the minimum needed to make the app work.

## What the app stores
**Stored locally on your device (SecureStore):**
- Spotify access/refresh tokens and granted scopes
- Your Spotify product tier (“premium/free/open”) to gate playback features
- A short-lived “pending play” URI + timestamp (lets us resume after login)
- Daily cleanup counter (free-tier limit)
- Theme preference
- **iOS only:** local in-app purchase flags (is Pro, plan) used to unlock features on this device

**We do not run a user database for Slicer.**  
No Spotify user ID, email, playlists, or listening history is uploaded to our servers.

## Data we read temporarily
To show and rank songs for cleanup, the app calls Spotify’s Web API to read:
- Your playlists and tracks
- (Optional) your recently played and top tracks

These responses are used in-app and not persisted to any server.

## Third-party services
- **Spotify SDK & Web API** for authentication and playback control.
- **Apple StoreKit (iOS)** to process purchases.
- **Stripe (Android)** via hosted Checkout/Portal pages. Slicer never sees your card details.

## Analytics & tracking
None. No analytics SDKs and no third-party advertising.

## Security & retention
All Slicer data is stored locally on your device. Deleting the app removes this data.  
If you email support, we’ll keep your message only as long as needed to help. You can request deletion at any time.
