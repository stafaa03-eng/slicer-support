## FAQ

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Why can’t I hear full songs?** | Full-length playback requires a **Spotify Premium** account. If you’re on the free tier you’ll only hear 30-second previews (or silence if the track has no preview). Upgrade to Premium or log in with a Premium account to hear the full track while swiping. |
