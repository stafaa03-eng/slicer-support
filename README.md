# Slicer – Support

Need help with the Slicer playlist-cleaning app?  
Email **stafaa03@gmail.com** and we’ll reply within 24 hours.

## Quick start (Apple Music)

- You need an **active Apple Music subscription** on the device.
- Make sure you’re **signed into Apple Music** in the iOS Settings → Music.
- In Slicer, choose **Apple Music → pick a playlist → swipe** right to keep / left to remove.  
  When you finish or navigate back, Slicer will offer to **create a cleaned copy**.

> ℹ️ Apple doesn’t let third-party apps delete tracks from your original playlist.  
> Slicer creates a **new playlist** that includes only the tracks you kept.

## FAQ

### I can’t hear music / playback doesn’t start
- Verify your **Apple Music subscription** is active on this device.
- Open the **Music** app, play any song, then return to Slicer and try again.
- Check the **ringer/silent switch**, volume, and **Bluetooth** output.

### How do I refresh playlists?

### How do I restore purchases?
- Slicer restores purchases **automatically** after sign-in.  
- You can also open **Settings → Restore Purchases** to trigger a manual restore.

### Which Apple Music data does Slicer access?
