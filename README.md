## FAQ

**Why can’t I hear music?**  
Full-length playback requires a **Spotify Premium** account.  
On free accounts, Slicer **does not play audio**—you can still swipe to keep/remove tracks.

**I have Premium but still hear nothing.**  
Make sure the Spotify app is installed and you’re logged into the same Premium account. Open Spotify, start any song, then return to Slicer and try again.

**What Spotify data does Slicer access?**  
Your playlists and tracks, your recently played tracks, your top tracks, and your account’s product tier—only to power the cleanup experience. Nothing is uploaded to Slicer servers.

**I hit the free limit.**  
Free users can remove **5 tracks per day**. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited cleans, or try again tomorrow.

**How do I restore purchases?**  
- **iOS:** Settings → **Restore Purchases** (Apple StoreKit).  
- **Android (when available):** Manage purchases via **Google Play**.

**How do I delete my data?**  
Delete the app to remove local data. To delete past support emails, contact us.
